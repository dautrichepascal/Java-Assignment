# Java-Assignment
This is an assignment for a program development course that requires the creation of a Java program that processes COVID-19 case data for Belgium. The program will read information from a file and perform various calculations based on user input such as statistics for a specific region, age group, or number of cases. The program will also write data back to a file and compare statistics generated with different parameters. The successful completion of the assignment demonstrated the ability to design a solution using pseudocode, identify data types, create simple classes, implement the design in Java, and produce well-structured and documented code.
